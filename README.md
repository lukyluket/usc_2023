# usc_2023
Material for the lectures at USC on 09/2023
The course involve 4 days, with 2 theory sessions each and one tutorial.

You will find
- the slides in the folder slides,
- the solved tutorials in the folder  tutorials with solutions and
- the text of the tutorials in the folder tutorials

 The material is not new but freely taken from my previous courses and the fantastic 
 Glen Evenbly and Philippe Corboz tuotorials and materials that can be found here
 
 ![Glen](www.tensors.net)
 
 ![Philippe](https://nextcloud.tfk.ph.tum.de/etn/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Philippe_Corboz.pdf)

 For the tutorial I strongly suggest you use the ***ncon*** function, a simple function that allows to contract complex network, that you will find in the tuotrial folder
